The poem by V.J. Cunningham "Meditation on Statistical Method"
being available at Brandeis University (see note by K.J. Wuensch)
is not solely a matter of randomness.  Cunningham taught English
literature for many years at Brandeis and poetry of high literary
quality about statistics is relatively rare.  To further perturb
us about coincidence.  In a very recent issue of "Physics Today"
the poem is quoted at the end of an article on the application of
statistics in physics.
     Cunningham who was a poet who left a very small corpus of
work, mainly literary criticism, and a book of his collected poems
published in 1971.  He was an epigrammatic poet and wrote a number
of short obscene epigrams of great elegance.  The influence of
Martial and Catullus is present in his work.  The quoted poem seems
to have been written sometime about 1946 and shows a clear understanding
of the statistical concepts he describes.  He has one other poem with
a mathematical theme, some 4 lines about the calculus.
      It is good to see his elegant and cynical work brought to the
attention of a statistical audience.
